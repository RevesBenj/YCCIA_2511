# ClinicB Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple clinic management system that helps keep track of patients, doctors, departments, and appointments in one place. It stores basic patient and doctor information and records appointment details so schedules don’t get confusing.

## What It Does
Doctors are assigned to specific departments, and patients can book appointments with them easily. The system can also show a list of senior patients and count how many doctors specialise in a certain area, making everyday clinic tasks easier to manage.
