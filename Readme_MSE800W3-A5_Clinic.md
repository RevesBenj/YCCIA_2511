# ClinicB Management System

## Overview
ClinicB is a simple clinic management system that keeps patients, doctors, departments, and appointments organized in one place. It stores basic details and appointment information to avoid scheduling confusion.

## What It Does
Admin staff can add and view doctors and patients, manage appointments, and keep records up to date. The system also makes it easy to identify senior patients and count doctors by specialisation, such as Ophthalmology.

Doctors can view their schedules and patient details, while patients can book appointments with available doctors. This helps reduce paperwork and keeps clinic operations smooth and well-coordinated.
