# College Course YCCIA Registration System

## Overview
This system helps a college organize information about students, teachers, courses, and departments. It stores basic student details such as name, contact information, date of birth, and address. Students can choose and register for different courses, and the system keeps track of which students are enrolled in which classes to avoid confusion.

## System Purpose
Each course is managed by a department and taught by a teacher. Departments offer various courses, and teachers may teach one or more classes. By keeping all this information in one place, the system simplifies course registration, supports teaching assignments, and ensures smooth operation for both students and staff.
